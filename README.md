# Personal-blog-website
## Description
 - This is my personal project to create a blog website.
 - I want this website to be a place where I can write articles about anything I learn, so I have remember what I learn better and I have a place to revise what I have learnt.
 - The very process of writing an article would require me to deep dive into the topic and articulate what I have learnt. This process will help me learn and remember new things better.
 - Planning to create a Pilot website and take my time to improve on this website and side by side start writing articles too.

## Pilot Details
 - I want the website to have a Home page, a page for each category of topics and separate pages for each article. 
 - I dont need the pilot to be fancy. I just want it to have the basic skeleton so I can start writing articles and publish it in this website.

## Future Ideas
 - Better the look and feel of the website
 - Create a chat bot in the website to interact reply with articles in this website as a knowledge base
